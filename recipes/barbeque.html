        <p>A few months ago my father got an inkling to make Beef Wellington, beef tenderloin smothered with mushroom duxelles,
             wrapped in puff pastry, and baked. Who knows where he got the idea, maybe just curiosity.
            Beef Wellington is one of those dishes that was a lot more popular 40 years ago than it is now.
             But once my dad decides he wants to make something, come hell or high water, it will be made.
            It also helps that Chef Gordon Ramsay has a video online on how to make his version of Beef Wellington, 
            using Parma ham wrapped around the tenderloin instead of the more traditional pâté de foie gras.</p>
